# Notes on C++

- From this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/117557): Even when an argument is passed by value, a `const` keyword might be useful as a way of *self-documenting* your assumptions. This makes your code more readable to your coworkers (and to a future you). Sometimes, `const` might even "help the compiler optimize things a bit (though it's a long shot)".
